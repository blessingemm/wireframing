# wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating simple, low-fidelity visual representations of a product's layout and functionality. Wireframes serve as blueprints for websites or applications, helping designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the structure and flow before any actual coding or high-fidelity design begins.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a significant role in the design and development of digital products for several reasons:

- **Clarifies structure and layout**: It provides a clear visual hierarchy, helping teams understand the placement of elements and how users will interact with the interface.
- **Encourages feedback early**: By presenting wireframes to stakeholders early in the project, teams can gather valuable input and make changes before development begins.
- **Saves time and resources**: Spotting and fixing layout issues in wireframes is faster and more cost-effective than during development or after launch.
- **Improves user experience**: Wireframes help ensure the product is intuitive, user-friendly, and aligned with user needs and expectations.
